Actions â€“ Dispatch intent.
Reducers â€“ Pure functions to change state.
Selectors â€“ Read state.
Effects â€“ Handle side effects (e.g., API calls).

ðŸ“˜ What to Learn Next

1. Feature State Modules
Organizing NgRx state by feature module
StoreModule.forFeature()
EffectsModule.forFeature()
This is key in scalable apps (lazy-loaded modules especially).

2. Entity State (NgRx Entity)
Managing collections (e.g. list of users/products) easily
Simplifies reducers/selectors for CRUD
Uses adapter: createEntityAdapter()
const adapter = createEntityAdapter<Product>();

3. Router Store
Connect Angular Router state with NgRx
Access route params in selectors
Dispatch navigation actions
npm install @ngrx/router-store

4. Immutability Best Practices
Deep understanding of immutable update patterns
Use immer, spread, or helper functions.

5. DevTools / Time Travel Debugging
Integrate with Redux DevTools Extension
npm install @ngrx/store-devtools
StoreDevtoolsModule.instrument({ maxAge: 25 })

6. NgRx Schematics (optional)
Auto-generate boilerplate
ng generate store --name=products --module=app

7. NgRx Signals (if using Angular v17+ with Signals)
Reactive programming with Signals integration
Explore @ngrx/signals package

8. NgRx Component Store (alternative to global store)
For local state in components/services
Simpler, more focused state management for isolated parts.
npm install @ngrx/component-store

9. Hydration / Persistence
Save and load store to/from localStorage
Use custom MetaReducers or libraries like ngrx-store-localstorage.

10. Testing in NgRx
How to test:
Actions
Reducers (pure functions â€“ easiest)
Effects (with provideMockActions) (Effects unit testing)
Selectors

Bonus (if time permits):
Custom Meta-Reducers (e.g., logging, error handling globally)
Lazy loading store/effects
NgRx Data (experimental) â€“ abstraction over Entity & Effects
